Hi! My name is Tyler and this is my personal site. I typically write about WordPress, Linux, Xbox 360&#8217;s, and various web things like CSS, PHP, and javascript. I am an extremely proud father, to two wonderous daughters. When I am not spending time with them, I can usually be found at a computer [building something][1] or in the timber cutting up the last of the ash trees.

I&#8217;ve also written a book, it&#8217;s titled [WordPress Multisite Security][2]. Check it out if you like that kind of thing.

You&#8217;ve likely come here in search of my one of my [WordPress projects][4]. [RootDip][5] and [Unwakeable][6] are two WordPress themes I&#8217;ve created, and [Thumbnail Viewer][7] is my WordPress plugin.

If you&#8217;re not here for anything WordPress related, you&#8217;re probably here researching problems you&#8217;re having with your [Xbox 360][8]. If that&#8217;s not it either, you&#8217;re probably looking to get the [Cisco VPN client working][9] under Linux.

Please feel free to [contact me][10] if you have any questions.
