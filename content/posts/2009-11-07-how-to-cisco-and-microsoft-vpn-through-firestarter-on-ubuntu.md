After doing a fresh install of Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala on my router, I realized that I had lost the ability to connect to my employer&#8217;s VPN. I use [Firestarter][1] for managing my firewall on this particular router.  
[ad]  
As I usually do, I googled &#8220;[firestarter vpn][2]&#8220;. Much to my dismay, it appeared that the [Firestarter website][1] was no longer alive. Instead of the usual Firestarter page, a page filled with useless links about security and anti-virus loaded. Luckily I was able to access the cached version of the page from Google. Since then, it appears that the [Firestarter website][1] has come back to life.

I wanted to make a note of how to allow VPN connections in the event that the Firestarter website becomes inaccessible again, that&#8217;s basically the point of this post. The page on the Firestarter site that details VPN connections can be [found here][3]. This should apply to pretty much every Linux distribution, not just Ubuntu.

To allow VPN connections with the **Microsoft VPN client**, simply enter the following lines into **_/etc/firestarter/user-pre_**.

<pre># Forward PPTP VPN client traffic
$IPT -A FORWARD -i $IF -o $INIF -p tcp --dport 1723 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$IPT -A FORWARD -i $IF -o $INIF -p 47 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$IPT -A FORWARD -i $INIF -o $IF -p 47 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
</pre>

[ad]  
And to allow VPN connections with the **Cisco VPN client**, enter the following lines into **_/etc/firestarter/user-pre_**.

<pre># Forward Cisco VPN client traffic
$IPT -A FORWARD -i $IF -o $INIF -p udp --dport 500 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$IPT -A FORWARD -i $IF -o $INIF -p tcp --dport 500 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$IPT -A FORWARD -i $IF -o $INIF -p 50 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$IPT -A FORWARD -i $INIF -o $IF -p 50 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT</pre>

Finally, if you&#8217;re running a **Microsoft VPN server** and want to allow incoming PPTP VPN connections, add the following lines to **_/etc/firestarter/user-pre_**.

<pre># Forward PPTP VPN connections to internal server
SERVER=192.168.0.100 # Internal VPN server

$IPT -A FORWARD -i $IF -o $INIF -p tcp --dport 1723 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$IPT -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $IF -p tcp --dport 1723 -j DNAT --to $SERVER
$IPT -A FORWARD -i $IF -o $INIF -p 47 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$IPT -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $IF -p 47 -j DNAT --to $SERVER 
</pre>

That should pretty much cover it. If you are using OpenVPN, head over to the [Firestarter VPN configuration][3] page for details.
