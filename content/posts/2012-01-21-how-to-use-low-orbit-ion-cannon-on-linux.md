## Compiling and Using Low Orbit Ion Cannon on Linux

This will help you get Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) running on Linux. A lot of the how-to&#8217;s out there for this are outdated and aren&#8217;t entirely relevant any longer.

I know for a fact it works with Xubuntu 13.04, so it should work with other Ubuntu variants as well, probably even Debian.

First, you&#8217;ll need to install mono-gmcs, mono-mcs, monodevelop, and liblog4net-cil-dev. You can install them like so: 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt-get install monodevelop mono-gmcs mono-mcs liblog4net-cil-dev</pre>

Running that will install all the packages you need to compile LOIC with Mono. Those 4 packages have other dependencies, so you&#8217;ll actually end up installing many more packages, but it&#8217;ll be done automatically.

After you&#8217;ve got that installed, download the [Low Orbit Ion Cannon from Github][1]. You can download it in .zip or .tar.gz format, whichever you&#8217;re most comfortable with.

Make a new folder on your desktop and extract the files from the .zip or .tar.gz to that new folder. Open a terminal and move into that folder (ie: `cd /home/tyler/Desktop/loic/)`.

Once you&#8217;re in the folder, type the following in your terminal: 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">mdtool build</pre>

That will compile LOIC, the executable will be in the **_debug_** folder that you extracted from the zip or tar.gz file you downloaded. After compiling is done, launch LOIC like so: 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">mono /path/to/loic/debug/LOIC.exe</pre>

That&#8217;s it, have fun! And don&#8217;t get in trouble.
