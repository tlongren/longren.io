After creating a new Droplet [using the pre-built WordPress image][1] provided by [DigitalOcean][2], you&#8217;re presented with a very helpful message after logging in via SSH:

> To finish installing WordPress, navigate to your dropletâ€™s IP: http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  
> Make sure to specify hostname from DO panel to your droplet before creating it (for example: â€˜blog.mydomain.comâ€™ or â€˜myblog.comâ€™)  
> This will create necessary Apache configs based on hostname and Apache will respond based on hostname.  
> Server will also respond to its IP address, so if you finish installation from http://IP then  
> you will need to change hostname from WordPress Settings later (from http://IP to http://hostname)

It&#8217;s a really helpful message, especially if you&#8217;re new to [DigitalOcean][2] and even more so if you&#8217;re new to hosting stuff on your own (ie: unmanaged hosting). However, the message isn&#8217;t really helpful after the first login, maybe two logins.

There&#8217;s [a great article][3] on how to get setup after using the One-Click WordPress install, but removing the message is never mentioned.

It&#8217;s just a [message of the day][4], the configuration for which can be found in `/etc/motd`. [Delete line 2][5], and you should be good to go.
