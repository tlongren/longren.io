## Frustration-free log management, plus a lot more {.subtitle}

I&#8217;ve been a huge fan of [Papertrail][1] ever since I discovered it, probably about a year ago or so. I use it mostly to monitor server logs. I currently have two servers setup to send syslog messages to [Papertrail][1].

The [Papertrail][1] Events dashboard can be a bit overwhelming at first, but the provided search is powerful and allows you to finely control which log messages you see and which you don&#8217;t.

You can even setup saved searches to fire when a specific event occurs. For example, I have a saved search that searches for the following:  
`Accepted publickey for tyler`

When that message shows up in [Papertrail][1], it means that I logged in, or that someone else has logged in using my SSH key. This can be quite handy, especially if you&#8217;re a one man shop like me and are usually the only person that has SSH or SFTP access to a server.

Getting a [DigitalOcean VPS][2] added to Papertrail, especially if it&#8217;s running Debian or Ubuntu, is super easy. It just requires that you modify `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and add a line to the end of the file that will send a copy of the system logs to [Papertrail][1].

[Papertrail][1] can monitor application logs, too, such as Apache httpd logs and MySQL server logs, although that takes a bit more configuration to get working properly.

If nothing else, it&#8217;s just nice having system logs aggregated in one central place, where everything is easy to search through, making it easy to find exactly what you&#8217;re looking for. If you&#8217;re an admin for one server or hundreds of servers, [Papertrail][1] could turn out to be one of your favorite tools. It&#8217;s definitely one of my favorites.

I suggest you [give Papertrail a try][1], can&#8217;t hurt, they even have a plan that&#8217;s free forever. It&#8217;s definitely a great service for monitoring server logs.
