## So easy to miss, but so important for SSH Private Key Authentication {.subtitle}

I don&#8217;t allow password logins on any of my servers. Can only login via SSH key based authentication. No root login is allowed, and I specify every user that&#8217;s allowed to login via SSH, _ie: me_.

If you&#8217;re a regular here, you know I love [DigitalOcean][1]. They have a [very nice tutorial on setting up SSH private key login][2], even walking you through creating SSH keys if you don&#8217;t already have one, and even adding that key to your [DigitalOcean][1] account.

None of that will be of interest to you if you already know how to generate SSH keys.

I&#8217;ll SSH into my new Droplet, only to be rejected. I immediately know why, because it&#8217;s happened so many times. It&#8217;s due to incorrect permissions on your Droplet, VPS, server, whatever.

For SSH private key authentication to work, the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file and the `~/.ssh` folder need specific permissions: 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</pre>

Run that, and then try logging in via SSH to your Droplet from your local machine. Should go this time.

If you still can&#8217;t login to your remote system, something else is likely wrong. If that&#8217;s the case, you&#8217;ll want to start at the top of [the DigitalOcean post about setting up SSH private key authentication][2] and just follow the steps.

After you&#8217;ve followed those steps, change permissions on the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file again and on the `~/.ssh` folder again. Like so from your terminal: 

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</pre>

## I&#8217;m curious&#8230;

If you do allow password logins, I&#8217;d love to hear what scenario causes you to need to allow password logins. Let me know in the comments if you don&#8217;t mind.
