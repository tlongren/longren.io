A few weeks ago at work, I noticed a bunch of failed login attempts to one of our Linux servers. After doing some investigation, I found that no intrusion had actually been made, which is excellent. Lines similar to this were filling my /var/log/messages log file:

> Aug 20 23:31:26 elixer sshd[22526]: Failed password for invalid user alias from 66.166.22.186 port 26217 ssh2

Notice they&#8217;re trying to login with the username &#8220;alias&#8221;, which doesn&#8217;t exist on that system. In fact, all the usernames attempted don&#8217;t exist, which makes me feel a little safer. Still, I don&#8217;t like seeing my boxes actively attacked. So, to stay on top of these breakin attempts, [I installed Breakinguard][1]. 

Breakinguard basically watches your log file for any failed login attempts. You can set a pre-defined number of attempts that can be executed before breakinguard will block the IP.

> The Package itself does a &#8216;tail -f&#8217; of your syslog, and when it identifies a matching line within your logs, it logs this &#8216;attempt&#8217;. If more than the pre-defined number of attempts from the same IP address are received it triggers the iptables (or any other block method defined) block and also emails you notification.

I&#8217;ve never been able to get the configure script to work for me, simply because the perl module installation always fails. So, to get around that I simply installed these perl modules manually and commented out these lines in the configure script:

<pre>$PERL -MCPAN -e "install File::Tail"
$PERL -MCPAN -e "install IO::Socket"</pre>

Those two lines execute perl and try to install the File::Tail module and the IO::Socket module. After manually installing the perl modules below and commenting out the lines above in the configure script, the configure script should run and do it&#8217;s thing without error.

> [File::Tail][2]  
> [IO::Socket][3] 

<!--adsense-->

  
After the configuration script has run, you should have a couple new files, /etc/breakinguard.conf and /etc/rc.d/breakinguard. Now, the /etc/breakinguard.conf file stores the breakinguard configuration. This is where you tell breakinguard which log file to monitor and how many incorrect login attempts are defined as a breakin.

I&#8217;m not going to bother going through all the options in breakinguard.conf, simply because they&#8217;re all explained pretty well within the conf file.

The other &#8220;new file&#8221;, /etc/rc.d/breakinguard is the script used to launch breakinguard. Run &#8220;/etc/rc.d/breakinguard start&#8221; to start breakinguard.

Once breakinguard is running, it will monitor whichever log file you specified in /etc/breakinguard.conf (/var/log/messages in my case). When it sees a failed login attempt, it will be noted. Now, when an IP fails a certain number of logins, iptables will be called to block all traffic from the IP.

Below is an example email that&#8217;s generated by Breakinguard when it blocks an IP:

> BreakinGuard has blocked an IP based on suspicious activity  
> Please review this server.
> 
> Detail:  
> Hostname: elixer.hostname  
> IP Blocked: 202.82.16.180  
> Last log entry that caused the block:  
> Aug 22 06:17:05 elixer sshd[25591]: Failed password for invalid user alias from 202.82.16.180 port 45340 ssh2
