[Stopping SSH Brute Force Attacks][1] resulted in some really [great][2] [comments][3] [and][4] [suggestions][5] from readers.

So, this is a follow up to [the last SSH brute force post][6]. I didn&#8217;t realize there was such a wide selection of applications for dealing with this, but there is! The two best looking options in my opinion are [Fail2ban][7] and [DenyHosts][8].

I&#8217;ve actually started using DenyHosts on two machines now, and it&#8217;s working very well. I chose to go with DenyHosts for a very simple reason. [Community stats][9]. I love stats.

Anyway, if you&#8217;re looking for something to protect against ssh brute force attacks, go with [Fail2ban][7] or [DenyHosts][8], they&#8217;re still being actively developed. I can&#8217;t say the same for [Breakinguard][10], as it appears to have been abandoned about 1 year ago. And like I said, [DenyHosts][8] does it&#8217;s job extremely well, I couldn&#8217;t ask for anything more.

If you&#8217;re looking for another solution, try using cryptographic keys instead of passwords. [A tutorial on configuring SSH][11] to look for keys instead of passwords [can be found here][11]. This [was suggested by][12] commenter [pwyll][13].

Oh, and this is the 700th post. yay!
