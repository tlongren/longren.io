I use some [software called ushare][1] to stream video from my pc to my Xbox 360. I won&#8217;t go into the details on how to set that up, it&#8217;s pretty straight forward. Chances are good that your linux distribution already has a package for ushare built.

If you find yourself with a video encoded in H.264/x264 (it&#8217;ll probably have a .mp4 file extension) you will be frustrated to find out that the Xbox 360 won&#8217;t play it. There is an incredibly easy workaround to this. Just change the .mp4 filename extension to .avi.  
[ad]  
Not sure exactly why this works, but I have a feeling it&#8217;s simply due to the .mp4 filename extension. The Xbox 360 must assume it doesn&#8217;t know how to play mp4 files, without actually checking to see what codec the video file needs. But that&#8217;s total speculation on my part.
