## Easily Reset WordPress Database {.subtitle}

[WordPress Database Reset][1] is a WordPress plugin I recently came across that will at some point prove very, very useful to me.

It&#8217;s not often that I need to reset a production WordPress database to it&#8217;s default settings, but this plugin will make the task a whole lot easier. [Chris Berthe][2], the author, describes the plugin like this:

> WordPress Database Reset is a secure and easy way to reinitialize your WordPress database back to its default settings without actually having to reinstall WordPress yourself. 

I can see this being crazy useful for WordPress plugin and theme developers. We frequently need a fresh database to work with, so I&#8217;ll be adopting this plugin in my WordPress plugin and theme development workflow from here on.

WordPress Database Reset requires WordPress 3.0+ and can be installed just like any other WordPress plugin. It&#8217;s in the [WordPress Plugin directory][3], and can [also be found on GitHub][1].

It even integrates with [WP-CLI][4], a command line tool for interacting with WordPress. This allows you to do things like select which tables you want to reset:

<pre class="lang:sh decode:true " >wp reset database --tables='users, posts, comments, options'</pre>

Here&#8217;s a list of features:

  * Extremely fast one click process to reset the WordPress database
  * Choose to reset the entire database or specific database tables
  * Secure and super simple to use
  * Prefer the command line? Reset the database in one command
  * Excellent for theme and plugin developers who need to clean the database of any unnecessary content quickly

If you&#8217;re a WordPress theme or plugin developer, you should [definitely check it out][1].
