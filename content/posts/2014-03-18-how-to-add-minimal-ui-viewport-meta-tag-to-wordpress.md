## Introduced with iOS 7.1

I don&#8217;t have an iPhone, but my daughter does have an iPad Mini, which is running the latest iOS, 7.1. However, this only works for [those of you on iPhone&#8217;s][1], so I see no difference. 

[Martin Wolf][2] was kind enough to let me use the [image from his post about this subject][3] so that I could more easily illustrate the difference. So, even if you don&#8217;t have an iPhone, you can still see the changes this makes in the featured image above.

With the release of iOS 7.1 (and possibly late 7.0.x builds), [Safari introduced support for a new value][3] in the `viewport` meta tag. To me, it sounds like it adds effects similar to how Chrome hides its top bar when a page is loaded, but more. For example, the navigation buttons at the bottom are hidden.

I rarely use Safari, like never. Chrome is available on iOS, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve always used. That&#8217;s not to say that you shouldn&#8217;t support Safari to it&#8217;s fullest, because I&#8217;d wager that a majority of iOS users stick with the default, which is Safari.

Chances are, your theme already has a `viewport` meta tag defined in it&#8217;s **header.php** file. If it does, add `minimal-ui` to it, so it should look something like this: 

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="html" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimal-ui" /&gt;</pre>

If your theme doesn&#8217;t already have a viewport meta tag set, you can add one with [your functionality plugin][4] or theme&#8217;s **functions.php** file like so: 

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="php" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;?php
function set_viewport() {
?>
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, minimal-ui">
&lt;?php
}
add_action('wp_head', 'set_viewport');
?></pre>

Adding the code above will add a brand new `viewport` meta tag for you, so only use that if your theme isn&#8217;t already using a `viewport` meta tag in it&#8217;s **header.php** file.

That&#8217;s it!
