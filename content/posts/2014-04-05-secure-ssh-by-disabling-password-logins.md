## Make bruteforce attempts almost impossible {.subtitle}

I always disable SSH password logins when setting up a new server, allowing authentication via private key only. It&#8217;s a good way to secure SSH all-around.

Disabling password logins in Ubuntu is extremely easy.

Open _/etc/ssh/sshd_config_ with nano or vi. You&#8217;ll want to change options for 3 different directives, `ChallengeResponseAuthentication`, `PasswordAuthentication`, and `UsePAM`.

Find those directives in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and set them to the following:

<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true " >ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM no</pre>

Save `sshd_config`, and reload ssh:

<pre class="lang:sh decode:true " >sudo service ssh reload</pre>

That&#8217;s it, now you won&#8217;t be able to SSH to your server and login with a password, and neither will anyone else.

Of course, you&#8217;ll want to enable private key authentication, first. If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll lock yourself out of your server.

DigitalOcean has a [good article on how to do this][1].

</div>

Let&#8217;s go a bit farther and only allow specific users to login via SSH. We can do so with by adding a line like the one below to _/etc/ssh/sshd_config_:

<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true " >AllowUsers firstuser seconduser thirduser</pre>

This will allow only three users to login: _firstuser_, _seconduser_, or _thirduser_. I usually add my _AllowUsers_ directive towards the top of sshd_config.

After modifying _/etc/ssh/sshd_config_, reload ssh again like so:

<pre class="lang:sh decode:true " >sudo service ssh reload</pre>
