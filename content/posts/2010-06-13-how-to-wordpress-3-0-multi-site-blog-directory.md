I&#8217;ve been using this WordPress page template lately for creating a directory page. The directory page lists every blog on a WordPress 3.0 multi-site setup and includes the author name, author bio, number of posts, last updated time, and gravatar. <del>One thing it DOES NOT include is recent posts. I will get around to adding that in a few weeks.</del> It also lists the 5 most recent posts for each blog.

I like using the [1kb css grid system][1] for laying pages out, so you can see what I use for css in the zip file. If you want to roll with that setup, you can just copy and paste the contents of **css.css** into the **style.css** file for your theme. And move **sign.png** into the **images/** folder for your theme. You&#8217;ll also want to do something with the **blog-directory.php** file.

**blog-directory.php** is a custom page template for Twenty Ten. If you&#8217;re using the Twenty Ten theme, you can just drop **blog-directory.php** into the &#8220;twentyten&#8221; theme folder and be done. If you&#8217;re using another theme you&#8217;ll need to open blog-directory.php and copy everything between **<!&#8211; start blog directory &#8211;>** and **<!&#8211; end blog directory &#8211;>** and paste it into a custom template for your theme.

If you&#8217;re not familiar with custom page templates in WordPress, you can [read about them here][2].
