I&#8217;ve used [Lapse It][1] for a long time. I didn&#8217;t use it often enough to buy the [Pro version][2] though. I discovered an [app named Droid Timelapse][3] the other day, and I love it. Droid Timelapse is developed by [Neximo Labs][4]. 

[Droid Timelapse][3] has a really nice user interface. It&#8217;s also got a lot of features that you don&#8217;t get in the free version of Lapse It.

If you want to take a time-lapse photo now and then, I&#8217;d definitely suggest [Droid Timelapse][3]. Lots of features, it&#8217;s free, has no ads, and has awesome reviews on the Play Store.

There&#8217;s a [pro version of Droid Timelapse][5] as well. It allows recording with the screen off and allows you to set custom capture rate intervals, up to 24 hours. It&#8217;s tempting to buy the pro version just to support development, but I really don&#8217;t use the app often. Maybe a few times a year when there&#8217;s some cool clouds rolling overhead.

I&#8217;ve included a gallery of screenshots below, but you&#8217;ll have to be viewing the full article to see them, they won&#8217;t show up on the front page.
